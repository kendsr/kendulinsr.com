			<h2>Some Stuff About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a retired software engineer with continued interests in coding, photography, walking and golf. This web site is an effort
				to combine and display these interests in an interesting form mostly for my own entertainment. If it pleases other observers then that's gravy.	</p>	
			<p>I enjoy following the developments in web technology through taking courses through 
				<a href="https://www.udemy.com/"><b>Udemy</b></a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/"><b>Free Code Camp</b></a> as well as 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/"><b>YouTube</b></a>. So it's time to see if anything has sunk in by actually building something that could be usefull.</p>
			<p>As an amaruer i have interests in landscape and bird photography. I am inspired by creative friends and family members who have done some wonderful
				things in this area.</p>
			<p>My walking interests are driven by my need for daily exercise and I strive to do this each day except when a round of golf presents itself. Recently,
				I have been taking my camera out on walks in nature parks nearby developing skills in capturing critters in digital.</p>
			<p>I'm not exactly sure how I'll get golf involved in this effort. I just enjoy getting outside to play especially with good friends.</p>
			<p>This site will evolve. It starts out as a single page application ( SPA for the techies out there ) but may change as I get
				more content to present. I don't have comment or contact functionality implemented. </p>
